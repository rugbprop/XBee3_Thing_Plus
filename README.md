The XBee3 Thing Plus is an ultra capable and easy way for getting into wireless device development. The combination of XBee and Qwiic in a space conscious design represents a much needed update to our XBee offering. With 20 I/O pins and Lithium Polymer Ion battery management, the XBee3 Thing Plus has all the basics for quickly prototyping or developing a connected device such as a remote sensor. The Qwiic connector and JST connector for the battery make for a solder-less option when working with the board which shortens setup time.

The new XBee3 Micro Module provides the classic all-but plug and play 802.15.4 2.4GHz wireless connection (Zigbee 3.0 Protocol) that makes it so desirable, but with a new addition of being programmable with MicroPython (32KB of memory available for it). RF data rates up to 250 Kbps and 200ft indoor ranges and up to 4000ft line-of-sight outdoor range. Communicating with/Configuring the module happens via an AT Command set or the Digi API, X-CTU, both locally or over-the-air. There's even a mobile version of X-CTU now; Digi XBeeÂ® Mobile.

This variation features a U.FL antenna connector for longer range communications. Check out the related products for compatible antennas.
